// You're packing chocolate bars into gift boxes. Each box needs to have the same number of chocolate bars. You need to find out how many boxes of chocolates you'll have after packing the bars.

// Problem Statement:
// Create a function that counts how many boxes you need based on the total number of chocolate bars and the number of chocolate bars per box, using a loop.

function countBoxes(totalBars, barsPerBox) {
    let boxes = 0
    while (totalBars >= barsPerBox) {
      boxes++ 
      totalBars -= barsPerBox
    }
    return boxes
  
  }
