// You’re tracking the number of steps you take during a workout. Each time you take a step, you want to count it. You keep stepping until you've reached a certain number of steps.

// Problem Statement:
// Create a function that uses a loop to count the number of steps during a workout. The loop should continue until you reach the target step count.

function countSteps(targetSteps) {
    let count = 0
    while (count < targetSteps) {
      count++
    }
    return count
    
  }
